I'm a bit obsesive with code and architecture quality, and having them done like
they could be put down on a textbook, or at least about they being used by
others as reference of how things can be done right. I've always feel a bit
frustrated that newcomers get and perpetuate bad habits, just because they
learned them that way on the first place by thinking that was the way to do the
things... Later, if things are working, people don't give a sh*t on thinking
about if there's a better way to do it, both to improve their work quality or
processes, or for learning and improve themselves, they just move on... So it's
better to do things right from the beginning, since later they are more
difficult to fix, or simply you forget to do it. And at the end, just by doing
things right on a first aproach, you get used to it and does them that way by
default :-)
