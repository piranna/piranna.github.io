title: Optimizing Git Branch Naming & Syncing with Upstream Repositories
---

When working with multiple remote repositories, especially when syncing changes
from upstream (such as in a forked repository), it's important to have a
well-structured system for organizing and tracking branches. This ensures
clarity, ease of maintenance, and the ability to manage branches effectively. In
this post, we'll walk through the decision-making process for setting up a clear
naming convention and syncing branches between your repository and an upstream
one.

## **The Problem: Syncing with Upstream Repositories**

When you contribute to a project that's not under your control (i.e., it's an
**upstream repository**), you often need to synchronize changes from that
repository to your own. This process typically involves fetching changes from
the upstream repository and pushing them to your origin (your repository), but
things can get messy when:

1. The **upstream repository** has many branches.
2. You want to track **multiple upstream branches** without interfering with
   your existing workflow.
3. The upstream repository's branch names could conflict with your own or have
   characters you want to avoid.

The goal is to **safely and clearly sync branches** from the upstream repository
into your own repository without creating confusion or conflicts.

## **1. Key Challenges to Address**

### **a. Avoiding Name Conflicts**

One of the primary challenges is avoiding conflicts in branch names. If the
upstream repository has branch names like `main`, `develop`, or `release`, these
could collide with your own branches, especially if you're working in a shared
or collaborative project.

### **b. Handling Upstream Branches**

Upstream repositories may not always follow the same naming conventions as your
own. For example:

- Your repository might use `main`, while the upstream one uses `master`.
- You might have extra long or descriptive branch names, such as
  `feature/add-new-feature`.

Having a robust system for identifying where each branch originates from will
keep things organized.

---

## **2. Approach to Solving the Problem**

The idea is to create a system where **upstream branches are mirrored** in your
repository with a clear, **safe naming convention** that avoids conflicts and is
easy to manage.

### **Naming Scheme**

We discussed two key alternatives for naming upstream branches:

1. **Prefix-based naming:**
   - This involves adding a prefix to the branch name, indicating the origin of
     the branch. For example:

     ```
     upstream.<domain>.<owner>.<project>.<branch>
     ```

   - **Pros:**
     - Keeps the naming system clear and prevents conflicts with your own
       branches.
     - Easy to identify the origin of the branch just by looking at the name.
     - Safe across different servers (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).

   - **Cons:**
     - Might look verbose, but the clarity it provides far outweighs this
       downside.

2. **Hashing encoding:**
   - An alternative to the prefix method involves using **hashing** to guarantee
     uniqueness for each upstream repository. This encoding ensures that no
     matter how complex the upstream URL or branch name, you have a
     **unique identifier**.
   - **Pros:**
     - Guarantees uniqueness across different upstream repositories.
     - Compact and avoids the need to use human-readable prefixes.

   - **Cons:**
     - Less human-readable (harder to interpret the name without decoding).
     - Adds unnecessary complexity for most cases.

   After considering these two methods, we decided that **prefix-based naming**
   was the cleaner and simpler option, which still provides clarity without the
   overhead of encoding.

### **Separator Choice**

Another important consideration was the separator used between the components of
the branch name.

1. **Slash (`/`)**:
   - Often used in Git for grouping or folder-like structures (e.g.,
     `feature/xyz`).
   - **Problem**: Since Git treats slashes as directory structures, it can cause
     unexpected behavior or interfere with the visibility of branches in some
     Git UIs.

2. **Dash (`-`)**:
   - This is a popular separator in Git branch names (e.g.,
     `feature/add-new-feature`).
   - **Problem**: The downside is that it can conflict with existing
     dash-separated names in project or organization names (e.g.,
     `awesome-project-name`).

3. **Dot (`.`)**:
   - After considering the pros and cons of dashes, we chose to use
     **dots (`.`)** as separators. The main reason for this is that **dots** do
     not have any special meaning in Git and do not conflict with other naming
     conventions.
   - **Pros**:
     - **Clarity**: Dots separate each component clearly (e.g.,
       `upstream.gitlab.company.project.main`).
     - **No conflict**: Works well even when the project or org names contain
       dashes.
     - **Professional appearance**.
   - **Cons**:
     - None significant â€” dots work well in practice.

---

## **3. The Final Solution**

Based on the discussion above, we arrived at the following strategy:

### **Step 1: Use Dots as Separators**

We decided to use **dots (`.`)** to separate different parts of the branch name
to avoid ambiguity and ensure clarity. The format for the branch names would
look like this:

```
upstream.<domain>.<owner>.<project>.<branch>
```

For example:

```
upstream.gitlab.company.project.main
```

This naming scheme guarantees:

- **Clarity** in identifying where the branch originated.
- **No name conflicts** with your own branches.
- **No special folder structure** issues (as would happen with slashes).

### **Step 2: Push Upstream Branches to Origin**

The following Bash script automates the process of fetching and pushing upstream
branches to your origin with the new names:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get upstream URL
UPSTREAM_URL=$(git remote get-url upstream)

# Extract server domain (without .com if present)
UPSTREAM_DOMAIN=$(echo "$UPSTREAM_URL" | sed -E 's#(https?://)?([^/]+)/.*#\2#' | sed 's/\.com$//')

# Extract owner and project
UPSTREAM_OWNER=$(basename -s .git $(dirname "$UPSTREAM_URL"))
UPSTREAM_PROJECT=$(basename -s .git "$UPSTREAM_URL")

# Compose the prefix
PREFIX="upstream.${UPSTREAM_DOMAIN}.${UPSTREAM_OWNER}.${UPSTREAM_PROJECT}"

# Fetch latest from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Push each upstream branch to origin with a namespaced branch name
for branch in $(git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:strip=3)' refs/remotes/upstream/); do
    remote_branch="${PREFIX}.${branch}"

    # Push upstream branch into origin with new name
    git push origin refs/remotes/upstream/${branch}:refs/heads/${remote_branch}
done
```

## **Explanation**

- The script fetches all branches from the upstream repository.
- It then **renames** each branch with a new name that includes the upstream
  information (e.g., `upstream.gitlab.company.project.main`).
- The branches are pushed to `origin`, making it easy to track changes from
  upstream while keeping everything organized.

---

## **4. Conclusion**

This strategy provides a clear and **safe system** for syncing upstream branches
into your repository. By using **dots as separators** and a consistent naming
convention, you can avoid conflicts and keep things simple. The solution:

- Is **easy to implement**.
- Helps avoid **confusion** about branch origins.
- Guarantees **clarity** and **future-proofing**.

While other strategies, like **hashing**, might offer uniqueness, they add
unnecessary complexity for most use cases. Stick with **dots** and
**clear prefixes** for the best results.

---

## **Final Thoughts**

Managing multiple remotes and branches can become complex, but by establishing a
clear, consistent naming convention, you can keep your Git workflows organized
and efficient. This approach not only helps with upstream synchronization but
also makes it easier for other developers to understand where each branch
originated from, minimizing errors and confusion.
