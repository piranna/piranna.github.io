Passionate computers engineer and ex-PhD. candidate in Computers Engineering.
Proud advocate of Open Source, standards and specifications.

With 15 years of professional experience and involved in Open Source scene and
wireless communities since 17 years old, I have been working both profesionally
or in personal side projects in almost all computer engineering areas, including
web development, robotics, operating systems desing, videogames, networking,
or drivers programming. My profile is purely technical, with a great interest in
hard-to-solve problems, quality of code, performance optimizations, high-edge
technologies, and design of clean APIs and architectures focused on minimal
designs, modularity and reusability.

I have won three times the spanish national
[Universitary Free Software Championship](https://www.concursosoftwarelibre.org)
and been CTO of two start-ups (and co-founder of one of them). Currently I'm
working as Tech Lead backend at [BotXO](https://www.botxo.ai) and as part-time
freelance developer, consultor and auditor. In my spare time i like to read
books, go to cinema or travelling, go running or cycling, or work on my own side
projects to improve my skills and craft things with cool high-edge technologies.
