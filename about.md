Passionate computers programmer and PhD. candidate in Computers Engineering.

With 15 years of professional experience and involved in Open Source communities
since more than 20 years ago, I have been working both profesionally or in
personal side projects in almost all computer engineering areas, including
frontend, backend, operating systems desing, videogames, networking or drivers
development. My profile is purely technical, with a great interest in
hard-to-solve problems, quality of code, performance optimizations, high-edge
technologies, open standards and specifications, and design of clean APIs and
architectures focused on minimal designs, modularity and reusability.

I have won three times the spanish national
[Universitary Free Software Championship](https://www.concursosoftwarelibre.org)
and been CTO of two start-ups, and currently I'm working as Tech Lead backend at
[BotXO](https://www.botxo.ai) and as part-time freelance developer.
