Passionate computers engineer and ex-PhD. candidate in Computers Engineering.
Proud advocate of Open Source, standards, specifications, and best practices.

With more than 18 years of professional experience, and involved in Open Source
scene and wireless communities since 17 years old, I have been working both
profesionally or in personal side projects in almost all computer engineering
areas, including web development, robotics, operating systems desing,
videogames, networking, or drivers programming. My profile is purely technical,
with a great interest in hard-to-solve problems, quality of code, performance
optimizations, high-edge technologies, and design of clean APIs and
architectures focused on minimal designs, modularity and reusability.

I have won three times the spanish national
[Universitary Free Software Championship](https://www.concursosoftwarelibre.org)
and been CTO of two start-ups (and co-founder of one of them). Currently I'm
working as Tech Lead backend at [BotXO](https://www.botxo.ai) and as part-time
freelance developer, consultor and auditor. In my spare time i like to read
books, go to cinema or travelling, go running or cycling, or work on my own side
projects to improve my skills and craft things with cool high-edge technologies.

### Recomendations & testimonies

[Diego González](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xmunch), Founder of SciArt Lab |
Software Engineer / Blockchain Expert at Docuten:

> Jesus is much more than a brilliant developer. He loves to achieve complex
> goals just by using a keyboard and a bunch of code lines. I would describe him
> as a creative and genius mind, a geek with a lot of technical skills but also
> with engagement and passion. Jesus is that kind of guy that can launch a
> project to the top. I strongly recommend him.

[Juan Francisco Gato Luis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jfcogato), Android R+D &
Singer:

> I don't need so much words to recommend Jesús. Just one case, if you need a
> man that works for a project and not for money, this guy could reach it. He
> just can do it, and if he don't how to made it, he will reach a way.

[Juan Searle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juansearle), CTO at Full Circle_ apps:

> I agree a lot with everything [you've proposed]. I'm surprised that you have
> owned the code in just some hours, without documentation and without mentoring
> from our side. Cool!
>
> This afternoon we'll have a call with the client and let's see if we get their
> aproval for the testing/refactoring, I'll keep you updated. We're going to
> propose it as a critical action to be done.
>
> ...
>
> Tell you that it has been a pleasure to count on you for this job: serious,
> decisive and accessible. My idea is to have someone to whom I can ask for
> NodeJs development and evolution of projects already done like this one from
> TVN, and I think I've found the right person. If you are still available I
> will count on you in future projects without a doubt.
