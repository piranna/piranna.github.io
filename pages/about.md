Passionate computers engineer and ex-PhD. candidate in Computers Engineering.
Proud advocate of Open Source, standards, specifications, and best practices.

With more than 18 years of professional experience, and being involved in Open
Source scene and wireless communities since I was 17 years old, I have been
working both profesionally or in personal side projects in almost all computer
engineering areas, including web development, robotics, operating systems
desing, videogames, networking, or drivers programming. My profile is purely
technical, with a great interest in hard-to-solve problems, quality of code,
performance optimizations, high-edge technologies, and design of clean APIs and
architectures focused on minimal designs, modularity and reusability.

I'm fullstack with preference for backend, R&D and academic projects. Thanks to
that, I have more than 10 years of experience with Node.js, and I'm also expert
in Python and C++ between other languajes, and I'm currently interested on Rust.
Regarding mobile apps, I have 5 years of experience with ReactNative.

I have won three times the spanish national
[Universitary Free Software Championship](https://www.concursosoftwarelibre.org)
and been CTO of two start-ups (and co-founder of one of them). Currently I'm
working as *WebRTC Architect* at [Dyte](https://www.dyte.io/) and as part-time
freelance developer, consultor and auditor. In my spare time I like to read
books, go to cinema or travelling, go running or cycling, or work on my own side
projects to improve my skills and craft things with cool high-edge technologies.

## Academic experience

I have a *Licenciature in Computers Engineering*, and convalidated It to the
equivalent *Master in Computers Engineering*. My Licenciature (and Master)
thesis was
*[NodeOS](projects.md#nodeos), a minimal operating system for Node.js based applications*,
with more than 6000 stargazers on GitHub, winner on the Systems category at the
[11th CUSL national championship](https://www.concursosoftwarelibre.org), and
graduated with distinction. My Licenciature thesis director was
[Prof. Enrique Soriano-Salvador](https://gsyc.urjc.es/~esoriano/).

I started my Ph.D., but currently is on-hold. My PhD thesis was *Co-focal
microscope techniques applied to neurology*, where I was compositing
multi-gigabyte high resolution multi-layer microscope scan images of neurons to
generate 3D models. My Ph.D. thesis director was
[Ph.D. Sofía Bayona-Beriso](https://gestion2.urjc.es/pdi/ver/sofia.bayona).

    > 4.10.1 Related work. JavaScript is rarely used for low-level code, the
    > most OS-like projects are **NodeOS** and OS.js. **NodeOS** uses the Linux
    > kernel with Node.js as user space. OS.js runs a window manager and
    > applications in the browser and is backed by a server running Node.js on
    > a normal OS. Neither of these implements driver-level code in JavaScript.

    > Among real life applications using the datachannel as best as they can, we
    > should definitely mention **shareit** and sharefest. Such applications
    > allow browsers to share files in the absence of any form of upload to
    > external servers, as opposed to well-known services such as Dropbox or
    > Google Drive. Both **shareit** and sharefest use an external server
    > holding and managing a connection to each peer; these connections are
    > used to accomplish all the signaling procedures between peers. Thus the
    > actual p2p communication happens during file transfers.

    **Note**: [ShareIt!](projects.md#shareit) used an external server to
    bootstrap the initial discovery and signaling with other peers, once they
    were connected to at least another peer and being part of the P2P network,
    the discovery and signaling with new peers was done directly between peers
    over the P2P network itself, leaving the connection with the external
    server as a fallback mechanims.

[Vaelsys](https://vaelsys.com/), July 2012:

> Jesus is a worker with a lot of knowledge in several technical areas, from
> low level programming up to scripting languages, and including devices
> integration that's where he was helping us. He is a person with a great
> interest for learning and improve himself each day, and I recommend him
> specially for his technical expertise and aptitudes.

[Diego González](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xmunch), Founder of SciArt Lab |
Software Engineer / Blockchain Expert at Docuten, May 2014:

> Jesus is much more than a brilliant developer. He loves to achieve complex
> goals just by using a keyboard and a bunch of code lines. I would describe him
> as a creative and genius mind, a geek with a lot of technical skills but also
> with engagement and passion. Jesus is that kind of guy that can launch a
> project to the top. I strongly recommend him.

[Juan Francisco Gato Luis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jfcogato), Android R+D &
Singer, May 2014:

> I don't need so much words to recommend Jesús. Just one case, if you need a
> man that works for a project and not for money, this guy could reach it. He
> just can do it, and if he don't [know] how to made it, he will reach a way.

[Juan Searle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juansearle), CTO at
[Full Circle_ apps](https://fullcircle.es/), December 2020:

> I agree a lot with everything [you've proposed]. I'm surprised that you have
> owned the code in just some hours, without documentation and without mentoring
> from our side. Cool!
>
> This afternoon we'll have a call with the client and let's see if we get their
> aproval for the testing/refactoring, I'll keep you updated. We're going to
> propose it as a critical action to be done.

> Tell you that it has been a pleasure to count on you for this job: serious,
> decisive and accessible. My idea is to have someone to whom I can ask for
> NodeJs development and evolution of projects already done like this one from
> TVN, and I think I've found the right person. If you are still available I
> will count on you in future projects without a doubt.
