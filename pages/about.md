Passionate computers engineer and ex-PhD. candidate in Computers Engineering.
Proud advocate of Open Source, standards, specifications, and best practices.

With more than 22 years of professional experience in software development, and
being involved in Open Source scene and wireless communities since I was 17
years old, I have been working both professionally or in personal side projects
in almost all computer engineering areas, including web development, robotics,
operating systems design, videogames, networking, drivers programming, or AI. My
profile is purely technical, with a great interest in hard-to-solve problems,
quality of code, performance optimizations, high-edge technologies, and design
of clean APIs and architectures focused on minimal designs, modularity and
reusability.

I'm fullstack with preference for backend, R&D and academic projects. Thanks to
that, I have more than 14 years of experience with Node.js (since v0.8), 19
years with Python (since 2.4), and 20 years with C++, between other languages
like Rust, Java or Go. Regarding mobile apps, I have 8 years of experience with
React Native, being also speaker at [Meta F8](/contributions#re-start).

I have won three times the spanish national
[Universitary Free Software Championship](https://www.concursosoftwarelibre.org)
and been CTO of several start-ups (and co-founder of two of them). In my spare
time I like to read books, go to cinema or travelling, go running or cycling, or
work on my own side projects to improve my skills and craft things with cool
high-edge technologies.

## Academic experience

I have a _Licenciature in Computers Engineering_, convalidated to the equivalent
_Master in Computers Engineering_. My Licenciature (and Master) thesis was
_[NodeOS](projects.md#nodeos), a minimal operating system for Node.js based
applications_, with more than 7000 stargazers on GitHub, winner on the Systems
category at the
[11th CUSL national championship](https://www.concursosoftwarelibre.org), and
graduated with distinction. My Licenciature thesis director was
[Prof. Enrique Soriano-Salvador](https://gsyc.urjc.es/~esoriano/).

I started my Ph.D., but currently is on-hold. My PhD thesis was _Co-focal
microscope techniques applied to neurology_, where I was compositing
multi-gigabyte high resolution multi-layer microscope scan images of neurons to
generate 3D models. My Ph.D. thesis director was
[Ph.D. Sofía Bayona-Beriso](https://gestion2.urjc.es/pdi/ver/sofia.bayona).

    > 4.10.1 Related work. JavaScript is rarely used for low-level code, the
    > most OS-like projects are **NodeOS** and OS.js. **NodeOS** uses the Linux
    > kernel with Node.js as user space. OS.js runs a window manager and
    > applications in the browser and is backed by a server running Node.js on a
    > normal OS. Neither of these implements driver-level code in JavaScript.

    > Among real life applications using the datachannel as best as they can, we
    > should definitely mention **shareit** and sharefest. Such applications
    > allow browsers to share files in the absence of any form of upload to
    > external servers, as opposed to well-known services such as Dropbox or
    > Google Drive. Both **shareit** and sharefest use an external server
    > holding and managing a connection to each peer; these connections are used
    > to accomplish all the signaling procedures between peers. Thus the actual
    > p2p communication happens during file transfers.

    **Note**: [ShareIt!](projects.md#shareit) used an external server to
    bootstrap the initial discovery and signaling with other peers, once they
    were connected to at least another peer and being part of the P2P network,
    the discovery and signaling with new peers was done directly between peers
    over the P2P network itself, leaving the connection with the external server
    as a fallback mechanims.
