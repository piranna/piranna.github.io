I've been working with [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) since 2012, less than a
year later it started to surface discussions about developing it, being one of
the pioneers of that technology here in Spain.

I got involved on that technology while developing
[ShareIt!](projects.md#shareit), the first serverless P2P filesharing
application fully written in JavaScript, and with whom I won the "Most
Innovative Project" award in the spanish national
[VII Free Software Universitary Championship](http://www.concursosoftwarelibre.org/1213/premiados-vii-cusl.html). To develop it, I needed to create
[DataChannel-polyfill](https://github.com/ShareIt-project/DataChannel-polyfill),
the first working implementation of WebRTC
[RTCDataChannel](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#rtcdatachannel) API four
months before it was available in experimental versions of both Chrome and
Firexfox browsers, using
[WebSocket](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/web-sockets.html#the-websocket-interface)s
instead of a
[SCTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_Control_Transmission_Protocol)
connection as transport layer.

Thanks to that both projects, I was invited to do a keynote in the first Spain
WebRTC summit, hosted at
[Madrid Polytechnic University](http://www.upm.es/internacional) in November
2012, and got a paragraph talking about my work at
[HTML5 for Masterminds](http://www.formasterminds.com/html5_for_masterminds_3rd_edition/) book, written by
[John D. Gauchat](http://www.jdgauchat.com/). After that, I was invited to work
at [eFace2Face](https://github.com/eface2face), and joined the
[Kurento](projects.md#kurento) team for two years.

In the next years, I've been working as WebRTC Expert for multiple projects,
including the two start-ups where I've been also working as CTO,
[UnifyMe](https://twitter.com/unify_me) and [lingbe](https://www.lingbe.com/).
But since short before the Covid-19 pandemic, I started to be contracted by each
times more companies to work as freelance WebRTC Expert, until December 2020
when I decided to work full-time ofering my services as WebRTC Architect, in
addition to develop my own WebRTC and streaming projects.
