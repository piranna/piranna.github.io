If you like the kind of projects and technologies I've been working on, I'm
available for hiring. I'm mainly interested on remote freelance projects (both
short and long term), but sometimes I'm open to considerate employee positions
or to do onsite projects if both the tasks and the offer are interesting, and we
can negotiate the terms and conditions. You can get more info about my past work
experience in my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piranna/) profile or in
my [Curriculum Vitae](Leganes-Combarro_Jesus_resume.pdf).

## My ideal job (AKA *Santa's letter*)

### How would it be

- Makes a difference, both for my career and to make the world a better place.
- "Make money" is a priority, but it's **not** the main priority (definitely,
  not the only one).
- Responsability position with decision on projects and company future.
- Travel frequently. If it's due assistance to conferences, that's a plus.

### What could it have

- Interesting and stimulating projects, allowing me to learn about new skills,
  technologies or knowledge areas (not necesarily computer engineering related).
- Research & Development projects, specially in academic contexts. Jobs with
  **real** posibilities of publishing academic papers will **always** be of my
  interest and have priority over others than don't.
- 100% remote positions with flexible schedule and
  [async communications](https://doist.com/blog/asynchronous-communication/)
  friendly, with clear specificacions, roadmap and requirements.
- Travel expenses and fully paid accomodation during all my relocation time.
- Bonuses and beneficts directly acountable to both my own performance and the
  company one.
- Acknowledge of my involvement in company progress, both short term (cash, paid
  extra holidays, travels, technological equipment...) and long term (shares or
  equity).
